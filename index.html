					What Is Scrum Methodology?
				</section>
				<section>
					You can define the Scrum methodology as a product delivery approach proposing principles and
					processes to improve outcomes.</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>How it works</section>
				<section>In Scrum management, projects make progress through sprints which represent one iteration of
					work towards the team’s goals. Each sprint or iteration produces a deliverable increment.</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>Why Scrum?</section>
				<section>One of the key reasons for Scrum's popularity is its ability to help teams deliver high-quality
					products and services in a fast and efficient manner. By breaking projects down into small,
					manageable chunks and regularly reviewing progress, teams can quickly identify and address any
					issues that arise. This allows them to stay on track and meet their goals in a timely manner.

				<section>Scrum team</section>
				<section>
					The Scrum environment promotes using small, flexible teams of no more than 9 people who work through the product backlog.

					Scrum Roles
				</section>
				<section>
					Scrum Development Team
				</section>
				<section>
					A Scrum development team is a group of professionals responsible for delivering a releasable
					increment of “done” at the end of each Sprint.
					Development teams are unique in the following ways:
					Development teams are self-organizing. Nobody within the Scrum team (not even the Scrum master) is
					allowed to tell them how to turn the product backlog into increments.
					They’re cross-functional. All members must have the skills required to create an increment; some can
					be differently skilled, but all should be able to pitch in.
				</section>
				<section>
					Scrum Master
				</section>
				<section>
					The Scrum master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process. They make sure everyone has a
					solid understanding of Scrum principles and offer guidance and teaching when it’s necessary.
					The Scrum master leads the Scrum team through the daily Scrum. They’ll often ask three questions:
					What did you do yesterday?
					What will you do tomorrow?
					What obstacles are in your way?
					The Scrum master is not the leader or people manager of a Scrum team. They are not directly
					responsible for outcomes. The whole team as a whole must accept responsibility for the end product.
				</section>
				<section>
					The Scrum master will also work with the product owner to make sure the project is on track.

					They’ll do tasks such as:

					Guaranteeing that the Scrum goals are understood by everyone.
					Optimizing product backlog management.
					Organizing Scrum events
					Helping to remove impediments when they arise
					The Scrum master’s job is to keep everyone focused and pushing towards the same goal. They are
					chartered to remove obstacles, prevent unnecessary distractions, and help the team make progress day
					after day. Even though the result of the Scrum ultimately rests on the entire team, Scrum masters
					often feel a lot of pressure to succeed in the position.
				</section>
				<section>
					Product Owner
				</section>
				<section>
					The product owner represents the business or customer base. They are there to ensure the other
					members of the Scrum team don’t forget the purpose of the sprint. Because of the wide variety of
					potential business users and customers, the product owner must have a strong understanding of the
					users needs.
					Each sprint begins with the product owner documenting and prioritizing the requirements and desired
					features of the product to the development team. In a planning session, the product owner’s job is
					to answer any questions the development team may have regarding specifications and requirements.

				<section>Scrum Events</section>
				<section>The Sprint</section>
				<section>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.</section>
				<section>Sprint Planning</section>
				<section>During a sprint planning event, the team agrees upon the series of product backlog items they will complete in the upcoming sprint.  For every one week of a sprint, an hour is set aside for sprint planning. </section>
				<section>Daily Scrum</section>
				<section>Each day, a daily Scrum meeting will take place where team members discuss progress they’ve made and problems they’re facing with the intent to celebrate progress, align current work and remove impediments swiftly to keep everyone moving forward.</section>
				<section>Sprint Review</section>
				<section>The sprint review meeting takes place at the end of a sprint with the expressed purpose of looking over the progress made. During a sprint review the product owner will assess if the results match the expectations set at the sprint planning meeting. Here, the product owner will verify that the increment of work meets the definition of done.</section>
				<section>Sprint Retrospective</section>
				<section>
					A sprint retrospective meeting allows your team to look back on past events and situations. According to the Scrum Guide, the sprint retrospective is an “opportunity for the Scrum team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint.” Makes sense, especially since the focus of agile development is continuous improvement. In order to get better, you have to know which sword to sharpen.

					Benefits Of The Scrum Methodology
				</section>
				<section>
					Increased productivity: When teams are able to work in short bursts of time called "sprints," they can typically achieve more than if they were working on the project over a longer period of time.
				</section>
				<section>
					Increased collaboration: The Scrum methodology encourages team members to work together closely to achieve common goals. This can help reduce misunderstandings and improve communication.
				</section>
				<section>Increased flexibility: The scrum methodology is flexible and can be adapted to meet the specific needs of the project team. This can help ensure that the project prioritizes completion of the most important items while keeping commitments of cost and schedule.</section>
				<section>Improved quality: By using short sprints, teams are able to focus on completing specific tasks and ensuring that they are of the highest quality possible. This can help avoid costly mistakes and improve the overall quality of the final product or service.</section>
